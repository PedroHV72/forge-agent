// census, named causes and an anti-silence floor.
//
// ── The locked boundary (S03-PLAN.md § 8, inherited from S07) ───────────────
//
// THIS MODULE SIGNALS. It does not sequence runs, it does not gate a dispatch,
// it does not suggest who merges first, it does not persist a queue and it
// does not perform speculative integration. Those together are an integration
// pipeline — a whole product — and they are out of scope BY DECISION, not for
// lack of time. The gate that REFUSES a dispatch is S04's, and it consumes
// this output; it must never be grown into this file, however natural the
// growth looks from here. `forge-claim-overlap.test.js` (and T03) assert that
// absence in executable form, by scanning this source with comments stripped.
//
// ── The polarity this module exists for (D1) ───────────────────────────────
//
// `forge-parallelism.writesConflict` (`forge-parallelism.js:107`) answers
// "empty list = no conflict". That is CORRECT INTRA-SLICE and is explicitly
// out of scope: there, both sides come from `T##-PLAN.md` frontmatter that the
// planner just wrote, so an empty `writes:` is a task that genuinely declares
// no writes, and two such tasks may safely run in parallel.
//
// CROSS-RUN the same shape means the opposite. A run whose claim is absent
// (`null`) or empty (`{ paths: [] }`) has not told us what it is about to
// write — and ABSENCE OF DECLARATION IS NEVER EVIDENCE OF SAFETY (D1). A
// comparator that read it as "no conflict" would hand out a clean bill of
// health to precisely the run nobody can vouch for. So here, an undeclared
// side is a CONFLICT, and it is a DIFFERENT conflict from a collision between
// two runs that did declare: the causes `undeclared-writes` and `overlap` are
// distinct, named, and never substituted for one another (S04 consumes exactly
// that distinction — it is born here, not there).
//
// The two polarities coexist ON PURPOSE. This module therefore reuses only
// `pathsOverlap` — the glob/prefix ALGEBRA — and NEVER the intra-slice
// predicate. T03 is the executable guard for both halves of that sentence.
//
// ── Composition, not reimplementation ──────────────────────────────────────
//
//   run universe       forge-runs.listAll
//   claim snapshot     forge-write-claim.readClaim   (T01)
//   path algebra       forge-parallelism.pathsOverlap
//
// A second glob algebra, or a second claim reader, would be the defect — not
// the feature (S03-PLAN.md § Standards).
//
// ── Posture ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Read-only and advisory. `exit 0` ALWAYS, including when a conflict is
// found (asserted by SPAWNING the CLI, never claimed in a comment). Writes
// nothing: no `RunRecord` is mutated, which the suite proves by SHA-256 of
// every `.gsd/forge/runs/*.json` before and after a `--check`.
//
// CLI:
//   node forge-claim-overlap.js --check [--json] [--all] [--cwd <dir>]
//   node forge-claim-overlap.js --list  [--json] [--all] [--cwd <dir>]

// The distinction D1 rests on. `undeclared-writes` is NOT a weaker
// `overlap` and must never be reported as one (nor the reverse): one says
// "a side never told us what it writes", the other says "both told us, and
// they collide". S04 refuses on the second and may choose differently on the
// first; collapsing them here would remove that choice from the layer that
// owns it.

// ── Skip reasons ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Why a run, or a PAIR of runs, did not participate in the comparison. Every
// value documents WHEN it is reachable; the suite asserts the crossing in
// BOTH directions (every reason this code emits is listed; every listed entry
// is emitted by >= 1 test). One-directional checking lets a dead entry rot or
// an undocumented one leak.
const CLAIM_SKIP_REASONS = [
  'run-inactive',              // `rec.active !== true` and `--all` was not given. Excluded by the default activity filter — never dropped silently.
  'different-code-dir',        // D2: the two runs write from DIFFERENT `code_dir`s, so identical paths denote different files. Pair skipped; `pairs_compared` NOT incremented.
  'not-comparable-single-run', // exactly one comparable run survived, so zero pairs exist. This is the named reason behind the `inconclusive` floor.
];

// ── Note reasons ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A note is NOT a skip: the run or pair STAYS in the comparison and the note
// records what is uncertain about it. Same closed-set discipline, same
// two-directional crossing.
const CLAIM_NOTE_REASONS = [
  'claim-absent',     // the run never recorded a claim. It STAYS comparable on purpose: D1 requires "did not declare" to be a VISIBLE conflict, not a run quietly dropped from the universe.
  'claim-empty',      // the run recorded a claim whose `paths` is empty — declared, and honestly empty. Still `undeclared-writes` cross-run (D1), and still distinct from `claim-absent` as a FACT about the record.
  'code-dir-unknown',    // one or both sides did not record a `code_dir`. The pair IS compared — excluding on unknown would be the exact polarity D1 forbids, one level up.
  'code-dir-relative',   // one or both sides recorded a NON-ABSOLUTE `code_dir`. A relative string names a directory only together with a base nobody recorded, so neither identity NOR difference was measured (R1). Treated as `unknown`: compared, never skipped, never called `same`.
  'code-dir-invalid',    // one or both sides persisted a `code_dir` that is not a string at all (a malformed record predating the write-side validation). Same posture: `unknown`, compared, named (R3).
  'code-dir-unresolved', // both sides are absolute but at least one could not be resolved to a real path (removed worktree, permissions). The comparison DEGRADED to lexical identity, and the degradation is named here rather than passing silently (R2).
