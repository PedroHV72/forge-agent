/*
 * forge-review-diff.js — the reviewable diff of ONE unit in an SVN working copy.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PROGRAM AND NOT THREE LINES OF BASH IN TWO MARKDOWN FILES
 *
 * `DIFF_CMD` is not merely executed by the review gate — arguments are APPENDED
 * to it by three separate consumers:
 *   - `$DIFF_CMD --name-only`        (pattern scan, both boundaries)
 *   - `eval "$DIFF_CMD" --name-only` (empty-diff probe, slice boundary)
 *   - `{DIFF_CMD} -- <files>`        (per-shard scoping, forge-review Step 2.0)
 * So `DIFF_CMD` must be ONE command that accepts those flags. A composed shell
 * string (`svn diff …; diff -u /dev/null new`) satisfies none of them, and plain
 * `svn diff` satisfies neither of the first two — `svn diff --name-only` does not
 * exist, which is why the SVN branch shipped in M017 is silently broken in every
 * consumer that appends. This program is that single command.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES BEYOND "no diff to review"
 *
 * 1. SCOPE. `svn diff` with no paths is the WHOLE working copy. SVN has no
 *    per-slice branch and no merge-base, and a working copy is routinely shared
 *    by several developers at once, so the unscoped diff carries other people's
 *    uncommitted work. Measured in the field: 49 files, 8 of them the unit's.
 *    A challenger spends its budget objecting to code the unit does not own.
 *    The diff is therefore intersected with a MANIFEST of the unit's paths.
 * 2. UNTRACKED FILES. `svn diff` cannot show an unversioned (`?`) file at all.
 *    Observed on a real slice whose entire change was two new files: the review
 *    would have read nothing and rendered CLEAN, which is the worst possible
 *    outcome for a gate. New files are reconstructed here as unified diff
 *    against /dev/null, in `svn diff` output shape.
 * 3. PEG REVISIONS — and the trap is the OPPOSITE of the obvious fix. A path
 *    containing `@` (`SERVICES/services@1.2.0` — real in this ecosystem) is read
 *    by most svn subcommands as `path@rev`, and the documented escape is a
 *    trailing `@`. Applying that escape here breaks EVERY path. Measured
 *    (svn 1.14.2, working-copy targets):
 *      svn diff -- src/services@1.2.0.ts    → works, `@` is part of the name
 *      svn diff -- src/services@1.2.0.ts@   → E155010, node '…ts@' not found
 *      svn diff -- src/plain.ts@            → E155010 as well
 *      svn diff -- 'weird@2'                → works, even though `2` is a valid
 *                                             revision — `svn diff` does not peg-
 *                                             parse working-copy targets at all
 *    while `svn info`/`svn add`/`svn delete` DO require the escape on the same
 *    paths. So diff targets are passed LITERALLY here, and the asymmetry is
 *    pinned by a test that exercises the real client rather than our model of
 *    it. (`--targets <file>` would sidestep the question entirely, but `svn
 *    diff` rejects that option — hence argv batching below.)
 *
 * BASELINE (decided, not defaulted). The diff is against BASE — the working
 * copy's own pristine revision — NOT against the `.start-sha` marker.
 *   - `svnversion` (what the marker records) returns things like `44531:44534M`
 *     in a mixed-revision working copy. That is not a revision `svn diff -r`
 *     accepts.
 *   - More decisively: in a SHARED working copy, diffing against a recorded
 *     revision would pull in every OTHER developer's commits landed since — the
 *     exact opposite of the scoping this program exists to provide.
 *   - "Uncommitted work" is what the unit produced when a team holds commits,
 *     and that is precisely `svn diff` against BASE.
 * So the SVN baseline marker is intentionally inert here, matching the existing
 * precedent in forge-vcs.js svnPostChanges ("SVN baseline is intentionally
 * inert: status is always compared to BASE").
 *
 * `.gsd/**` is excluded before any of this: Forge's own plans, summaries and
 * evidence logs are not the code under review, and in an SVN working copy they
 * sit in the tree as unversioned files rather than being ignored by a branch
 * nobody reviews. Uses the repo's canonical `isGsdPath` predicate; the count is
 * reported as `gsd_excluded` rather than padding the `excluded` list.
 *
 * NEVER EMPTY BY SCOPING. If the manifest is absent, or intersects nothing, the
 * scope falls back to every changed path (today's unscoped behavior) and says so
 * in --scope-report. Emitting an empty diff because scoping mis-fired would make
 * the gate write "no diff to review" and pass — silence indistinguishable from a
 * clean review.
 *
 * CLI:
 *   node forge-review-diff.js --cwd <dir> [--paths-file <f>] [--unit-dir <d>]
 *                             [--name-only] [--scope-report] [-- <files...>]
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 produced output (possibly empty), 2 bad arguments or not SVN.
